        <h3 style = "color: rgb(82, 82, 185);">PROLOGUE</h3>
        
        Two households, both alike in  dignity,
        <br>In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
        <br>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
        <br>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
        <br>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
        <br>A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
        <br>Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
        <br>Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
        <br>The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
        <br>And the continuance of their parents' rage,
        <br>Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
        <br>Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
        <br>The which if you with patient ears attend,
        <br>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

        Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
        <h3 style = "color: rgb(60, 60, 136);">GREGORY</h3>
        No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
